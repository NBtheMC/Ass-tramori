I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 37, in script
    "It’s only been a few days since I moved to the city, but I’d be lying if I said I was enjoying it."
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 114, in _window_auto_callback
    _window_show(auto=True)
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 69, in _window_show
    renpy.with_statement(trans)
IOError: Couldn't find file 'audio/MasksRequired.mp3'.
